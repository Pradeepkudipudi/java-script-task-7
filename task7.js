// 1.Traffic Light System
// Simulate a traffic light system:

// If the light is green, log "Go."
// If the input doesn't match any color, log "Invalid input."

// 2.Weather Description (Temperature Descriptions)
// Write a program that describes the temperature:

// If the temperature is exactly 0, log "It's freezing cold."
// If the temperature is exactly 15, log "It's a cool day."
// If the temperature is exactly 25, log "It's a pleasant day."
// If the temperature doesn't match any of these, log "Unknown weather."

// 3.: Day of the Week

// Create a program that takes input of a number representing the day of the week (1-7):

// If the number is 1, log "Today is Monday."
// If the number is 2, log "Today is Tuesday."
// If the number is 3, log "Today is Wednesday."
// If the number is 4, log "Today is Thursday."
// If the number is 5, log "Today is Friday."
// If the number is 6, log "Today is Saturday."
// If the number is 7, log "Today is Sunday."
// If the input is not between 1 and 7, log "Invalid day number."
